# PALETTE | Post-processing profiles for TUFX


# This is PALETTE.

## A set of customized, TUFX-based color profiles for KSP to spice up your game's visuals. This is a continuation/expansion/replacement of my original mod, the KASA Flag Pack and TUFX Profile.

 
**THE PROFILES!**
There are 10 in total. They are:

1. *Lighthouse V2:* An improved version of *Lighthouse*, with boosted contrast, color saturation and improved auto exposure. A map-friendly version is included.
2. *Aperture:* A black-and-white color config designed to resemble such images taken with modern cameras.
3. *Lighthouse:* The standard profile. An updated version of Orbit with a slightly warmer, more natural tone. A map-friendly version is included.
4. *Spheres:* A VERY intense, VERY bluish profile. Meant for use in cool environments.
5. *Luna:* A muted, more neutral tone meant for environments such as the Mun or Dres.
6. *Kerbosawa Mode:* A black-and-white profile meant to emulate Ghost of Tsushima's Kurosawa Mode.
7. *Baldwin:* A reddish profile, meant for use in places like Duna or deserts.
8. *Orbit:* The mod's old standard profile. It has a bluish tone and bright lighting.
9. *Heisenberg:* A gritty, yellowish tone based on Breaking Bad.
10. *The Really Old One:* My very first profile, the one included in the original mod.
